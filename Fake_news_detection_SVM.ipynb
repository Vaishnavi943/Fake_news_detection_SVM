According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He met with representatives from the coal industry to sign a bill undoing Obama s coal mining rule. The people s president is a worker!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SCOTT PRUITT S APPOINTMENT TO EPA CHIEF THE LEFT WENT BONKERS!OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL SCOTT PRUITT is another perfect choice from President-elect Donald Trump. He s sued the feds several times for their overreach in regulations on the coal industry. You have to love his commitment to keeping the federal government on the straight and narrow. It s funny that so many of Trump s picks have gone against Obama s policies We love it! The lefty politicians in DC wasted no time tweeted out their displeasure:When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing\",\n          \" (In this Oct. 13 story, corrects description of legal standard regarding Trump in paragraph 15) By Alison Frankel and Dan Levine (Reuters) - Donald Trump hasn\\u2019t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  A lawyer for the New York real estate developer demanded on Wednesday The New York Times retract a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriately touching them. If the newspaper did not comply, Trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would \\u201cpursue all available actions and remedies,\\u201d the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said in a letter.  Trump said at a rally on Thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  An attorney for the Times, David McCraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would \\u201cwelcome the opportunity\\u201d to defend it in court. Over the years, media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the Village Voice, the New York Post and Fortune Magazine have reported receiving similar threats from Trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. However, Trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a Reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service Westlaw, a unit of Thomson Reuters.   \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. Trump filed the case after the Chicago Tribune\\u2019s architecture critic called his proposed 150-story Manhattan skyscraper an \\u201catrocious, ugly monstrosity.\\u201d In 1985, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a First Amendment right to express his opinion. The skyscraper was never built. In the 32 years since Trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. He was successful in one of those cases.  Book author and former New York Times reporter Timothy O\\u2019Brien defeated a Trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after Trump underwent a grueling deposition by O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s lawyers.  Trump\\u2019s suit against O\\u2019Brien, which also named O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s publisher, Time Warner Book Group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman\\u2019s net worth. A New Jersey state judge found in 2009 that Trump had not established O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s actual malice. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Former Miss Universe contestant Sheena Monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which Trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as \\u201crigged.\\u201d The arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in Manhattan in 2013. The court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The same year, a San Diego federal judge ruled Tarla Makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against Trump University, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the Better Business Bureau that Trump University engaged in fraudulent business practices. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, dismissed Trump\\u2019s defamation claim. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Trump\\u2019s attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the Reuters docket search may have missed. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0U.S. courts have routinely deemed Trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. That means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d for the truth. If Trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. The New York Times attorney, David McCraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. Any Trump claim will be difficult because Trump\\u2019s accusers were on the record, said Jane Kirtley, a media law expert at University of Minnesota Law School. That would bolster the newspaper\\u2019s argument that it didn\\u2019t act recklessly in publishing their accounts. Trump has vowed to \\u201copen up our libel laws,\\u201d if he wins the presidency on Nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. In reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. Court records show that Trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. Most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a Trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a Trump casino in Indiana, were dismissed. One defamation suit against Trump survived dismissal, however. Stock analyst Marvin Roffman sued Trump for $2 million in federal court in Philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. Roffman alleged Trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. After a federal judge refused to toss the case, the Trump Organization settled in 1991. An attorney for Roffman declined to comment. \",\n          \"MOSCOW (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that London could not ignore Russia s meddling in elections around the world, its actions in Ukraine, or the persecution of gay people in Chechnya.

Flashpoint is said to be investigating the nature of the alleged  hacker DDoS attacks against the networks of the internet traffic management company Dyn and many others just days ago.Later in this report, we ll focus our attention on the uncanny ties between the firm Flashpoint, the Orlando Shooting and the massive internet related outage this past week.But first things first, let s review elements of the recent DDoS attack in America   CYBER GAMES    The DDoS attack story falls in line with a designer western political agenda. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)On October 21st, the technology blog Engadget discussed the cyber attacks that led to an internet outage across America and other parts of the world: Today s nation-wide internet outage was enabled thanks to a Mirai botnet that hacked into connected home devices, according to security intelligence company Flashpoint. The distributed denial of service attack targeted Dyn, a large domain name server, and took down Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, The New York Times, Pinterest, PayPal and other major websites. Flashpoint has observed Mirai attack commands issued against Dyn infrastructure,  Flashpoint writes.  Analysts are still investigating the potential impact of this activity and it is not yet clear if other botnets are involved. The Engadget article mentioned above, further explained that security experts had been prepping the public for an eventual Mirai malware attack since its code open-source was leaked: The author of the Mirai malware made its code open-source, and security experts have been warning of a possible large-scale attack since this information came to light. In another media supplied back story the coming  launch  of Mirai was discussed through the security based website managed by Brian Krebs, on KrebsOnSecurity   who ironically, have twice been the victim of cyber attacks over the years: The source code that powers the  Internet of Things  (IoT) botnet responsible for launching the historically large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against KrebsOnSecurity last month has been publicly released. Interestingly, according to Bradley Barth, a senior reporter for the IT security online magazine SC, the Mirai (supposedly leaked on September 30th) contains a very unique subset of characteristics that will not attack certain IP addresses such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the US Postal Service and consumer giant General Electric (GE) due to its coding: An Imperva analysis of the source code revealed several unique traits, including a hardcoded blacklist of IPs that the adversary did not want to attack, perhaps in order to keep a low profile. Some of these IPs belonged to the Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service and General Electric (GE). Though SC claims that the makers of Mirai may have been trying to keep a low profile, the recent DDoS attack attributed to the malware was as high-profile as you can get   so this begs the question, what was the real reason the malware creators put an IP blockade on the DoD, the Postal Service and GE?Is it possible the malware originated from whitehat hackers associated with the US government, or from a major US defense contractor like GE?Politico disclosed that the hacktivist avatar known as the  New World Hackers  and Anonymous (now a ubiquitous brand which could be anyone or anything) were responsible for the DDoS attack on Twitter and others, adding that  U.S. officials preached caution, arguing there is still scant evidence to determine who is behind the attack, warning that both groups have falsely taken credit for high-profile attacks in the past.  Flashpoint then declared that the group were  imposters,  as the article then referenced Obama s recent far-fetched claims that Russia is somehow  meddling  with US elections through proxy hackers   once again, without offering any definitive proof.Mainstream media pundits, including those at CNN, were also quick to dismiss the New World Hackers as an  illegitimate group  who had  falsely taken credit for hacks in the past. Less than 24 hours after the nationwide DDoS cyberattack, former Homeland Security Advisor to United States President George W. Bush, Fran Townsend, (left photo) reignited the ever popular blame Russia  meme (as we predicted) in a CBS article: CBS News homeland security consultant Fran Townsend pointed to Russia as a possible instigator. Is this sort of a brushback pitch from the Russians sending us a message that we should be pretty careful about engaging in this sort of cyberactivity with them because they are very capable,  she said. Townsend, also made the rounds on media after the bizarre anomaly ridden Nice Attack, pushing the mainstream narrative.In our first report regarding the alleged hack on America, we discussed the DDoS event and how it would be politicized by the media and US officials to blame Russia, feeding into the false claims that the Kremlin is somehow tampering with the 2016 US elections. We also talked about how the incident might be used to push a newer and more restrictive Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and its Senate doppelg nger, the PROTECT IP Act aka PIPA   dual provisions aimed at restricting the use of copyrighted material on the internet, which could have vast implications on free speech. It is also important to reiterate that one of the main issues concerning the US government as the cyberspshere grows is ISP  governance  which is code for making ISP comply to any unlawful requests by Federal authorities   including cutting internet access to individuals or organizations deemed to be  undesirable  by the state.Last week s choreographed cyber attack on popular websites and companies that allegedly spread through the Mirai botnet malware via the Internet of Things (IoT), has opened up another aspect of the story. This part of the narrative, appears to prey on the fears of the general public as IoT devices have become increasingly connected, setting the stage for new security protocols and new cyber security products to be conveniently rolled out at any future date following a cyber crisis.It should be mentioned that the security firm Flashpoint was front and center (along with the internet performance company DYN)   weighing in on the situation prior to any US intelligence agency making an official statement.Flashpoint operates as an intelligence watchdog, as well as an intelligence asset, in addition to playing a PR role for some recent large-scale incidents   but who are they really?  PUZZLE PIECE     The security firm Flashpoint delves into the deep dark web for its clients. Screen Shot Image Source: (flashpoint-intel.com)Meet FlashpointAccording to Flashpoint s own website, they are a private cybersecurity firm that is composed of a diverse crew of white-hat hackers, engineers, analysts, salespeople, marketers, and operations specialists [who] are fearlessly problem-solving as we change the way organizations evaluate risk. The clandestine firm adds that their  premium Business Risk Intelligence solutions afford superlative access and visibility into opaque areas of the Internet, empowering our clients to defend themselves against various cyber and physical threats. While looking into Flashpoint s investor section, we learn that the American venture capital firm Greycroft Partners is listed among those contributing to the security firm. It turns out that Greycroft is also a large campaign contributor to the Clinton campaign, as discussed by Huffinton Post: At least eight hedge funders are listed as Clinton fundraisers, collecting more than $100,000 each for the campaign. These include Blair Effron of Centerview Partners, Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group, Orin Kramer of Boston Provident, Charles Myers of Evercore, Deven Parekh of Insight Venture Partners, Alan Patricof of Greycroft Partners, and Lisa Perry, who is married to Perry Capital CEO Richard Perry.  FLARE UP    Here s Flashpoint s mission statement. (Screen Shot Image Source: (flashpoint-intel.com)While Greycroft s contributions to the Clinton campaign are somewhat of a sidebar to the recent internet outage attack, it does represent another uncanny business and political connection that links a secretive firm (Flashpoint) that appears to be taking a large role in steering the public s perception over certain incidents occurring in America. You have to wonder if this is really just a coincidence?By this, we can see just how tight the elite inner circle is, with a small collective of corporate and media gatekeeper   and their political operatives   all carefully stage-managing the narrative around almost every high-profile controversial event in America, and also in Europe too.From America s largest mass shooting to America s largest Internet outage?On June 24th, less than two weeks after the Orlando shooting at Pulse Nightclub, Flashpoint was said to have acted as a  translator  for al Qaeda s terror publication Inspire, which according to the security-based firm, appeared to be  claiming some responsibility  for the shooting even though the purported shooter Omar Mateen was allegedly linked to ISIS.The NBC report stated the following on June 24th: Flashpoint co-founder Evan Kohlmann, an NBC terrorism analyst pointed out that even though Mateen cited ISIS as the inspiration for the attack, al Qaeda seemed to be claiming some responsibility because it has called for  lone wolf  attacks against the West. Kohlmann said the statement   which lauded Mateen as a heroic  lone jihad  holy warrior   appears to be an official Inspire release. But he said it was far less professional than others, including one after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that went to great lengths to praise the Tsarnaev brothers, who said they learned to make their explosive devices from another Inspire publication. The purported terror publication Inspire has come under fire in recent years as some critics charge that the magazine may actually be a CIA creation, something which is echoed through its ties to the dubious AQAP terror operation.During our summertime investigation into the suspicious events at the Orlando Pulse nightclub, we found evidence that Omar Mateen s worldwide security firm G4S was a client of the crisis staging company called Crisis Cast. The following is a passage from that report: Truth is often stranger than fiction when looking at the bizarre phenomena surrounding many mass casualty incidents   and the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting was no exception.It was recently revealed that the world s largest security firm G4S, who had employed the man named in the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting, Omar Mateen  is a client of the mass casualty staging company called CrisisCast.   STAGING REALITY    CrisisCast specializes in replicating mass casualty events. (Screen Shot Image Source crisiscast)Casting Crisis & Training for Disaster The heavily-stylized company CrisisCast, appears to be a revamped version of the Visionbox Crisis Actors project (a crisis actor production emerging after Sandy Hook), with a professional team of actors, elaborate film crews, expert producers and theatrical effects makeup squads mimicking real-life injuries (additional prosthetics)   all focused to deliver a simulated crisis-likereality to the public, later to be managed accordingly through their public relations division via various forms of social media. RELATED: (VIDEO)  Active Shooter  and  Terror  Drills: The Truth WILL Shock YouInterestingly, another client listed on the Crisis Cast website appeared to be another company named Flashpoint, apparently unrelated to the internet based security firm   MILITARIZED    Another company also called Flashpoint, was tacitly connected to the Orlando shooting via Crisis Cast. (Screen Shot Image Source crisiscast)There is nothing concrete linking the two Flashpoint companies but the very fact that both are tied to the Orlando shooting, albeit in an opaque way, suggests there could be some deeper connection.Is  Flashpoint   Reality Based Training,  the militarized counterpart to the cybersecurity firm Flashpoint?Here s Flashpoint   Reality Based Training describing the reality they construct for their clients, which appears to fall in line with the internet based Flashpoint: Environments will need to become more realistic   the sights, sounds and smells will increase in fidelity.  We believe the requirement for combined live and virtual events will increase and that these will be networked geographically by governments, military and NGOs. We also anticipate an increase in the requirement for us to track trainees and deliver accurate after-action reviews as part of our Reality Based Training. What s next in a world with designed outcomes, false narratives, uncanny connections and staged crises?All we have to do is follow the money.READ MORE ORLANDO SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Orlando FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\",\n          \"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The Republican-dominated Texas House of Representative approved on Thursday a bill to punish so-called \\u201csanctuary cities\\u201d over criticism from Democrats that the measure could lead to unconstitutional racial profiling. The bill comes as Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has made combating illegal immigration a priority. Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million undocumented immigrants and the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, has been at the forefront of the immigration debate. Texas\\u2019 Republican leaders have embraced Trump\\u2019s calls to punish localities they believe are shielding immigrants in the country illegally. Any anti-sanctuary city measure may face a tough road after a federal judge this week blocked Trump\\u2019s executive order seeking to withhold funds from local authorities that do not use their resources to advance federal immigration laws. On a party line vote after about 16 hours of emotional debate, the Texas House approved the bill that would punish local authorities who do not abide by requests to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Police who do not cooperate with immigration authorities could be subject to fines and prosecution for a Class A misdemeanor, which can bring up to a year imprisonment.  The bill also allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention, even for minor infractions like jay-walking. The bill will have to be reconciled with another bill approved by the Texas Senate. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has said he would sign such a measure into law. \\u201cThis bill has no effect on illegal immigrants if they have not committed a crime or are hanging out with someone who has,\\u201d bill sponsor Republican Charlie Geren told the House. Under questioning, Geren told lawmakers there are no local authorities in Texas at present that he would consider a \\u201csanctuary city.\\u201d Rene Oliveira, a Democratic representative from the border city of Brownsville, said the bill has sent a chill through immigrant communities worried that even people in the United States legally can be picked up by police for minor infractions and subject to a process aimed at deportation. As the Texas House debated the measure, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who runs one of the nation\\u2019s largest police forces, criticized the bill. \\u201cViolent crime is on rise across our Nation & some would rather men & women in blue go after cooks & nannies, instead of hardened criminals,\\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \",\n          \"The swamp is draining One more RINO is not running for reelection. Senator Jeff Flake announced he will not run again today in a vindictive speech against President Trump and Republicans. Hey, the guy was even thinking of running as an Independent what does that tell you? He s NOT a conservative! He mentioned in his speech that he couldn t support Trump s policies on trade and immigration. Well, those two policies are what got Trump elected!FLAKE WAS 26 POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS:The bombshell, which Flake, R-Ariz., detailed Tuesday afternoon on the Senate floor, will further roil Republican hopes of keeping the party s 52-seat Senate majority in the midterm elections of Trump s first term, when the president s party historically loses seats in Congress.It also likely will upend the race for Flake s seat.Flake, one of the Senate s more prominent critics of President Donald Trump, has been struggling in the polls.A GRANDSTANDING AND VINDICTIVE SPEECH:He told The Arizona Republic ahead of his announcement that he has become convinced  there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party. Flake said he has not  soured on the Senate  and loves the institution, but that as a traditional, libertarian-leaning conservative Republican he is out of step with today s Trump-dominated GOP. This spell will pass, but not by next year,  Flake said.Among Republican primary voters, there s overwhelming support for Trump s positions and  behavior,  Flake said, and one of their top concerns is whether a candidate is with the president or against him. While Flake said he is with Trump on some issues, on other issues he is not. And Trump definitely views him as a foe, having denounced Flake publicly and called him  toxic  on Twitter. Here s the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I m not willing to take, and that I can t in good conscience take,  Flake told The Republic in a telephone interview.  It would require me to believe in positions I don t hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone. LAURA INGRAHAM COULDN T HAVE SAID IT BETTER:Flake was for the disastrous Trans Pacific Partnership, NAFTA, open immig, blanket amnesty and had Hillary won, he'd be happy today.  Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) October 24, 2017As of Sept. 30, Flake s campaign had $3.4 million on hand. He has continued to raise money   as recently as Thursday, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice headlined a fundraiser for him in Arizona.Flake said he has ruled out running as an independent rather than a Republican, saying he didn t think that was a viable strategy. He also said he has  no intention  of making a presidential run.SENATE RACE HEATS UP:Kelli Ward, the former state senator from Lake Havasu City who lost her primary challenge last year against Sen. John McCain, has emerged this year as the top GOP alternative to Flake, but other names have been mentioned as possibilities: Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham and Arizona Board of Regents member Jay Heiler. Lesser-known Republicans Craig Brittain and Nicholas Tutora also have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and are running.But Flake s exit is sure to prompt bigger Arizona Republican names to take a fresh look at the GOP Senate race.Steve Bannon, Trump s controversial former White House strategist, has embraced Ward as part of his national  open revolt  against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the GOP establishment. But other Republicans have warned that Ward is a weak candidate whose nomination would jeopardize GOP chances of holding Arizona s Senate seat.The winner of the Aug. 28 Republican primary could face Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., considered the front-runner in her the Democratic Senate primary.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised Flake as  one of the finest human beings I ve met in politicsFlake publicly announced his intentions in a Senate floor speech that began around noon Arizona time.In a copy of prepared remarks released to The Republic before his speech, Flake gave a blistering critique of the  coarseness of our national dialogue  that has defined the Trump era, saying it should never become accommodated as a  the new normal.

Flashpoint is said to be investigating the nature of the alleged  hacker DDoS attacks against the networks of the internet traffic management company Dyn and many others just days ago.Later in this report, we ll focus our attention on the uncanny ties between the firm Flashpoint, the Orlando Shooting and the massive internet related outage this past week.But first things first, let s review elements of the recent DDoS attack in America   CYBER GAMES    The DDoS attack story falls in line with a designer western political agenda. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)On October 21st, the technology blog Engadget discussed the cyber attacks that led to an internet outage across America and other parts of the world: Today s nation-wide internet outage was enabled thanks to a Mirai botnet that hacked into connected home devices, according to security intelligence company Flashpoint. The distributed denial of service attack targeted Dyn, a large domain name server, and took down Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, The New York Times, Pinterest, PayPal and other major websites. Flashpoint has observed Mirai attack commands issued against Dyn infrastructure,  Flashpoint writes.  Analysts are still investigating the potential impact of this activity and it is not yet clear if other botnets are involved. The Engadget article mentioned above, further explained that security experts had been prepping the public for an eventual Mirai malware attack since its code open-source was leaked: The author of the Mirai malware made its code open-source, and security experts have been warning of a possible large-scale attack since this information came to light. In another media supplied back story the coming  launch  of Mirai was discussed through the security based website managed by Brian Krebs, on KrebsOnSecurity   who ironically, have twice been the victim of cyber attacks over the years: The source code that powers the  Internet of Things  (IoT) botnet responsible for launching the historically large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against KrebsOnSecurity last month has been publicly released. Interestingly, according to Bradley Barth, a senior reporter for the IT security online magazine SC, the Mirai (supposedly leaked on September 30th) contains a very unique subset of characteristics that will not attack certain IP addresses such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the US Postal Service and consumer giant General Electric (GE) due to its coding: An Imperva analysis of the source code revealed several unique traits, including a hardcoded blacklist of IPs that the adversary did not want to attack, perhaps in order to keep a low profile. Some of these IPs belonged to the Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service and General Electric (GE). Though SC claims that the makers of Mirai may have been trying to keep a low profile, the recent DDoS attack attributed to the malware was as high-profile as you can get   so this begs the question, what was the real reason the malware creators put an IP blockade on the DoD, the Postal Service and GE?Is it possible the malware originated from whitehat hackers associated with the US government, or from a major US defense contractor like GE?Politico disclosed that the hacktivist avatar known as the  New World Hackers  and Anonymous (now a ubiquitous brand which could be anyone or anything) were responsible for the DDoS attack on Twitter and others, adding that  U.S. officials preached caution, arguing there is still scant evidence to determine who is behind the attack, warning that both groups have falsely taken credit for high-profile attacks in the past.  Flashpoint then declared that the group were  imposters,  as the article then referenced Obama s recent far-fetched claims that Russia is somehow  meddling  with US elections through proxy hackers   once again, without offering any definitive proof.Mainstream media pundits, including those at CNN, were also quick to dismiss the New World Hackers as an  illegitimate group  who had  falsely taken credit for hacks in the past. Less than 24 hours after the nationwide DDoS cyberattack, former Homeland Security Advisor to United States President George W. Bush, Fran Townsend, (left photo) reignited the ever popular blame Russia  meme (as we predicted) in a CBS article: CBS News homeland security consultant Fran Townsend pointed to Russia as a possible instigator. Is this sort of a brushback pitch from the Russians sending us a message that we should be pretty careful about engaging in this sort of cyberactivity with them because they are very capable,  she said. Townsend, also made the rounds on media after the bizarre anomaly ridden Nice Attack, pushing the mainstream narrative.In our first report regarding the alleged hack on America, we discussed the DDoS event and how it would be politicized by the media and US officials to blame Russia, feeding into the false claims that the Kremlin is somehow tampering with the 2016 US elections. We also talked about how the incident might be used to push a newer and more restrictive Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and its Senate doppelg nger, the PROTECT IP Act aka PIPA   dual provisions aimed at restricting the use of copyrighted material on the internet, which could have vast implications on free speech. It is also important to reiterate that one of the main issues concerning the US government as the cyberspshere grows is ISP  governance  which is code for making ISP comply to any unlawful requests by Federal authorities   including cutting internet access to individuals or organizations deemed to be  undesirable  by the state.Last week s choreographed cyber attack on popular websites and companies that allegedly spread through the Mirai botnet malware via the Internet of Things (IoT), has opened up another aspect of the story. This part of the narrative, appears to prey on the fears of the general public as IoT devices have become increasingly connected, setting the stage for new security protocols and new cyber security products to be conveniently rolled out at any future date following a cyber crisis.It should be mentioned that the security firm Flashpoint was front and center (along with the internet performance company DYN)   weighing in on the situation prior to any US intelligence agency making an official statement.Flashpoint operates as an intelligence watchdog, as well as an intelligence asset, in addition to playing a PR role for some recent large-scale incidents   but who are they really?  PUZZLE PIECE     The security firm Flashpoint delves into the deep dark web for its clients. Screen Shot Image Source: (flashpoint-intel.com)Meet FlashpointAccording to Flashpoint s own website, they are a private cybersecurity firm that is composed of a diverse crew of white-hat hackers, engineers, analysts, salespeople, marketers, and operations specialists [who] are fearlessly problem-solving as we change the way organizations evaluate risk. The clandestine firm adds that their  premium Business Risk Intelligence solutions afford superlative access and visibility into opaque areas of the Internet, empowering our clients to defend themselves against various cyber and physical threats. While looking into Flashpoint s investor section, we learn that the American venture capital firm Greycroft Partners is listed among those contributing to the security firm. It turns out that Greycroft is also a large campaign contributor to the Clinton campaign, as discussed by Huffinton Post: At least eight hedge funders are listed as Clinton fundraisers, collecting more than $100,000 each for the campaign. These include Blair Effron of Centerview Partners, Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group, Orin Kramer of Boston Provident, Charles Myers of Evercore, Deven Parekh of Insight Venture Partners, Alan Patricof of Greycroft Partners, and Lisa Perry, who is married to Perry Capital CEO Richard Perry.  FLARE UP    Here s Flashpoint s mission statement. (Screen Shot Image Source: (flashpoint-intel.com)While Greycroft s contributions to the Clinton campaign are somewhat of a sidebar to the recent internet outage attack, it does represent another uncanny business and political connection that links a secretive firm (Flashpoint) that appears to be taking a large role in steering the public s perception over certain incidents occurring in America. You have to wonder if this is really just a coincidence?By this, we can see just how tight the elite inner circle is, with a small collective of corporate and media gatekeeper   and their political operatives   all carefully stage-managing the narrative around almost every high-profile controversial event in America, and also in Europe too.From America s largest mass shooting to America s largest Internet outage?On June 24th, less than two weeks after the Orlando shooting at Pulse Nightclub, Flashpoint was said to have acted as a  translator  for al Qaeda s terror publication Inspire, which according to the security-based firm, appeared to be  claiming some responsibility  for the shooting even though the purported shooter Omar Mateen was allegedly linked to ISIS.The NBC report stated the following on June 24th: Flashpoint co-founder Evan Kohlmann, an NBC terrorism analyst pointed out that even though Mateen cited ISIS as the inspiration for the attack, al Qaeda seemed to be claiming some responsibility because it has called for  lone wolf  attacks against the West. Kohlmann said the statement   which lauded Mateen as a heroic  lone jihad  holy warrior   appears to be an official Inspire release. But he said it was far less professional than others, including one after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that went to great lengths to praise the Tsarnaev brothers, who said they learned to make their explosive devices from another Inspire publication. The purported terror publication Inspire has come under fire in recent years as some critics charge that the magazine may actually be a CIA creation, something which is echoed through its ties to the dubious AQAP terror operation.During our summertime investigation into the suspicious events at the Orlando Pulse nightclub, we found evidence that Omar Mateen s worldwide security firm G4S was a client of the crisis staging company called Crisis Cast. The following is a passage from that report: Truth is often stranger than fiction when looking at the bizarre phenomena surrounding many mass casualty incidents   and the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting was no exception.It was recently revealed that the world s largest security firm G4S, who had employed the man named in the Orlando pulse nightclub shooting, Omar Mateen  is a client of the mass casualty staging company called CrisisCast.   STAGING REALITY    CrisisCast specializes in replicating mass casualty events. (Screen Shot Image Source crisiscast)Casting Crisis & Training for Disaster The heavily-stylized company CrisisCast, appears to be a revamped version of the Visionbox Crisis Actors project (a crisis actor production emerging after Sandy Hook), with a professional team of actors, elaborate film crews, expert producers and theatrical effects makeup squads mimicking real-life injuries (additional prosthetics)   all focused to deliver a simulated crisis-likereality to the public, later to be managed accordingly through their public relations division via various forms of social media. RELATED: (VIDEO)  Active Shooter  and  Terror  Drills: The Truth WILL Shock YouInterestingly, another client listed on the Crisis Cast website appeared to be another company named Flashpoint, apparently unrelated to the internet based security firm   MILITARIZED    Another company also called Flashpoint, was tacitly connected to the Orlando shooting via Crisis Cast. (Screen Shot Image Source crisiscast)There is nothing concrete linking the two Flashpoint companies but the very fact that both are tied to the Orlando shooting, albeit in an opaque way, suggests there could be some deeper connection.Is  Flashpoint   Reality Based Training,  the militarized counterpart to the cybersecurity firm Flashpoint?Here s Flashpoint   Reality Based Training describing the reality they construct for their clients, which appears to fall in line with the internet based Flashpoint: Environments will need to become more realistic   the sights, sounds and smells will increase in fidelity.  We believe the requirement for combined live and virtual events will increase and that these will be networked geographically by governments, military and NGOs. We also anticipate an increase in the requirement for us to track trainees and deliver accurate after-action reviews as part of our Reality Based Training. What s next in a world with designed outcomes, false narratives, uncanny connections and staged crises?All we have to do is follow the money.READ MORE ORLANDO SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Orlando FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\",\n          \"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The Republican-dominated Texas House of Representative approved on Thursday a bill to punish so-called \\u201csanctuary cities\\u201d over criticism from Democrats that the measure could lead to unconstitutional racial profiling. The bill comes as Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has made combating illegal immigration a priority. Texas, which has an estimated 1.5 million undocumented immigrants and the longest border with Mexico of any U.S. state, has been at the forefront of the immigration debate. Texas\\u2019 Republican leaders have embraced Trump\\u2019s calls to punish localities they believe are shielding immigrants in the country illegally. Any anti-sanctuary city measure may face a tough road after a federal judge this week blocked Trump\\u2019s executive order seeking to withhold funds from local authorities that do not use their resources to advance federal immigration laws. On a party line vote after about 16 hours of emotional debate, the Texas House approved the bill that would punish local authorities who do not abide by requests to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Police who do not cooperate with immigration authorities could be subject to fines and prosecution for a Class A misdemeanor, which can bring up to a year imprisonment.  The bill also allows police to ask people about their immigration status during a lawful detention, even for minor infractions like jay-walking. The bill will have to be reconciled with another bill approved by the Texas Senate. Republican Governor Greg Abbott has said he would sign such a measure into law. \\u201cThis bill has no effect on illegal immigrants if they have not committed a crime or are hanging out with someone who has,\\u201d bill sponsor Republican Charlie Geren told the House. Under questioning, Geren told lawmakers there are no local authorities in Texas at present that he would consider a \\u201csanctuary city.\\u201d Rene Oliveira, a Democratic representative from the border city of Brownsville, said the bill has sent a chill through immigrant communities worried that even people in the United States legally can be picked up by police for minor infractions and subject to a process aimed at deportation. As the Texas House debated the measure, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who runs one of the nation\\u2019s largest police forces, criticized the bill. \\u201cViolent crime is on rise across our Nation & some would rather men & women in blue go after cooks & nannies, instead of hardened criminals,\\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \",\n          \"The swamp is draining One more RINO is not running for reelection. Senator Jeff Flake announced he will not run again today in a vindictive speech against President Trump and Republicans. Hey, the guy was even thinking of running as an Independent what does that tell you? He s NOT a conservative! He mentioned in his speech that he couldn t support Trump s policies on trade and immigration. Well, those two policies are what got Trump elected!FLAKE WAS 26 POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS:The bombshell, which Flake, R-Ariz., detailed Tuesday afternoon on the Senate floor, will further roil Republican hopes of keeping the party s 52-seat Senate majority in the midterm elections of Trump s first term, when the president s party historically loses seats in Congress.It also likely will upend the race for Flake s seat.Flake, one of the Senate s more prominent critics of President Donald Trump, has been struggling in the polls.A GRANDSTANDING AND VINDICTIVE SPEECH:He told The Arizona Republic ahead of his announcement that he has become convinced  there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party. Flake said he has not  soured on the Senate  and loves the institution, but that as a traditional, libertarian-leaning conservative Republican he is out of step with today s Trump-dominated GOP. This spell will pass, but not by next year,  Flake said.Among Republican primary voters, there s overwhelming support for Trump s positions and  behavior,  Flake said, and one of their top concerns is whether a candidate is with the president or against him. While Flake said he is with Trump on some issues, on other issues he is not. And Trump definitely views him as a foe, having denounced Flake publicly and called him  toxic  on Twitter. Here s the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I m not willing to take, and that I can t in good conscience take,  Flake told The Republic in a telephone interview.  It would require me to believe in positions I don t hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone. LAURA INGRAHAM COULDN T HAVE SAID IT BETTER:Flake was for the disastrous Trans Pacific Partnership, NAFTA, open immig, blanket amnesty and had Hillary won, he'd be happy today.  Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) October 24, 2017As of Sept. 30, Flake s campaign had $3.4 million on hand. He has continued to raise money   as recently as Thursday, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice headlined a fundraiser for him in Arizona.Flake said he has ruled out running as an independent rather than a Republican, saying he didn t think that was a viable strategy. He also said he has  no intention  of making a presidential run.SENATE RACE HEATS UP:Kelli Ward, the former state senator from Lake Havasu City who lost her primary challenge last year against Sen. John McCain, has emerged this year as the top GOP alternative to Flake, but other names have been mentioned as possibilities: Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham and Arizona Board of Regents member Jay Heiler. Lesser-known Republicans Craig Brittain and Nicholas Tutora also have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and are running.But Flake s exit is sure to prompt bigger Arizona Republican names to take a fresh look at the GOP Senate race.Steve Bannon, Trump s controversial former White House strategist, has embraced Ward as part of his national  open revolt  against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the GOP establishment. But other Republicans have warned that Ward is a weak candidate whose nomination would jeopardize GOP chances of holding Arizona s Senate seat.The winner of the Aug. 28 Republican primary could face Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., considered the front-runner in her the Democratic Senate primary.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised Flake as  one of the finest human beings I ve met in politicsFlake publicly announced his intentions in a Senate floor speech that began around noon Arizona time.In a copy of prepared remarks released to The Republic before his speech, Flake gave a blistering critique of the  coarseness of our national dialogue  that has defined the Trump era, saying it should never become accommodated as a  the new normal.
